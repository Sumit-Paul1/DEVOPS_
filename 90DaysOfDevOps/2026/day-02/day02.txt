Day 02 – Linux Architecture, Processes, and systemd
 Core Components of Linux
 Kernel

The heart of Linux
Manages:

CPU

Memory

Devices

File systems

Acts as bridge between hardware and software
User Space

Where users and applications run

Examples:Bash shellDockerNginx

Cannot directly access hardware (must go through kernel)

Init / systemd

First process started by kernel

Has PID 1

Responsible for:

Starting services

Managing background processes

Handling system boot

Modern Linux uses systemd as init system.

How Processes Are Created

Every process has:

PID (Process ID)

PPID (Parent Process ID)

Process Creation Flow:

Parent process uses fork()

Child process created

exec() loads program into memory

Example:

bash → runs → ls

Here:

bash = parent

ls = child

 Process States
State	Meaning
Running (R)	Currently using CPU
Sleeping (S)	Waiting for event/input
Stopped (T)	Paused process
Zombie (Z)	Finished but not cleaned by parent
Uninterruptible (D)	Waiting for I/O

Check using:

ps aux
top
What systemd Does

systemd: Manages system services , Handles boot process , Restarts failed services ,Manages logs (journald)
Common commands:

systemctl start nginx
systemctl stop nginx
systemctl restart nginx
systemctl status nginx
systemctl enable nginx

Why it matters:

Ensures services run automatically

Critical for production servers

Used in DevOps troubleshooting daily

 Daily Linux Commands
ls        # list files
cd        # change directory
ps aux    # check processes
top       # monitor system
systemctl # manage services
Summary

Kernel manages hardware.

User space runs applications.

systemd manages services and boot.

Processes are created using fork + exec.

Understanding this helps in debugging servers.
