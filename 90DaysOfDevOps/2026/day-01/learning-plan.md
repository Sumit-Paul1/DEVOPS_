90 Days of DevOps – Learning Plan

Name: Sumit Paul
Current Level: Working Professional (4 years IT experience, 2–3 years as Cloud Administrator)
Time Commitment: 2–3 hours on weekdays, 5–6 hours on weekends

1. My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud

DevOps is not just tools — it is a culture of automation, ownership, fast feedback, and reliable delivery. It focuses on CI/CD, Infrastructure as Code, observability, and collaboration between development and operations.

Cloud Engineering enables scalable, automated infrastructure using platforms like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.

As a Cloud Administrator, I manage infrastructure. As a DevOps Engineer, I will automate, optimize, and own the full delivery lifecycle.

2. Why I Am Learning DevOps

To transition from manual cloud operations to automation-first engineering

To increase my market value

To gain production-grade CI/CD and Kubernetes expertise

To build strong debugging and system design capability

I want to move from support-focused responsibilities to high-impact engineering execution.

3. My 90-Day Goals

By Day 90, I will:

Deploy a production-grade microservice application on Kubernetes

Build a complete CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins integrating Git, Docker, and automated deployment

Provision infrastructure on Amazon Web Services using Terraform with modular Infrastructure as Code

4. 3 Core DevOps Skills I Will Build

Infrastructure as Code (Terraform + AWS)

CI/CD & Automation (Git, Jenkins, Docker pipelines)

Kubernetes Deployment & Troubleshooting

Bonus focus: Linux debugging & monitoring fundamentals.

5. Weekly Execution Plan

Weeks 1–3:
Linux deep dive, networking, shell scripting, Git mastery

Weeks 4–6:
Docker + CI/CD pipelines + Jenkins project

Weeks 7–9:
Kubernetes (deployment, services, ingress, troubleshooting)

Weeks 10–12:
Terraform + AWS project (VPC, EC2, IAM, EKS)
Final Capstone: End-to-end CI/CD + K8s deployment

6. Consistency & Discipline Rules

Fixed study time: 8–10 PM daily

Minimum 1 hands-on implementation daily

Push code to GitHub 

Sunday = revision + project enhancement

Final Commitment

For the next 90 days, I will operate like a DevOps Engineer — not a learner.
I will prioritize automation, hands-on projects, and real-world problem solving.


This is my career upgrade plan.
